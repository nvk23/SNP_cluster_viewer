### Repo still under construction

3 Branches:
  - Main: Related to Cluster Buster project - Plotly plots for large scale sample populations
  - SNCA Artifact Exploration - compare genotypes of SNPs in potential artifact region vs. outside region
  - NBA vs WGS - compare SNPs across modalities (NBA raw and imputed genotypes, Short-read Whole Genome Sequencing SNPs)
